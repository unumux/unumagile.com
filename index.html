                                Agile is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotoes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and encourages rapid and flexible reponse to change. It is a conceptual framework that focuses on frequently delivering small increments of working software.

                            It is through daily customer (or customer proxy) collaboration that industry data shows that agile projects have more than twice the success rate of traditional projects on average worldwide. Because agile recognize the value of customer engagement, they have created a place on their development teams that is specifically for the customer representative.

                            We are working toward an approach to transition to an Agile organization. In the meantime we want to provide resources to continue to raise awareness and understanding of Agile across the enterprise.

                    <dt>What training is available on agile?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            There are many resources available on agile internally and externally. Internally, there is an Enterprise Agility site with loads of information: <a href="http://communities/sites/AgileUnum/SitePages/Home.aspx">http://communities/sites/AgileUnum/SitePages/Home.aspx</a>. There are also training courses available on LDS: Intro to Scrum/Scrum 101 which is a set of videos and a quiz (about 45 min) as well as an Agile Executive training offering on LDS. There is also tons of information available through external resources such as ScrumAlliance and AgileAlliance.

                        <p>
                            Scrum is an Agile Framework of lightweight practices for completing complex projects. Scrum originally was formalized for software development projects, but it works well for any complex, innovative scope of work. The possibilities are endless. The Scrum framework is deceptively simple.

                    <dt>What is Kanban?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            A method for managing work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members. In this approach, the process, from definition of a task to its delivery to the customer, is displayed for participants to see and team members pull work from a queue.

                    <dt>What are agile roles?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            In pure agile, the roles are Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team (everyone else). This approach works well with small to medium size companies. When using agile on a large scale (scaling agile), the complexity of organizational structures, imbedded cultural behaviors, specialized roles, etc. causes the need for a deeper level of understanding and definition of roles. The Agile Working Team is working through this along with the Operating Model job simplification track and more information will be shared as the agile model and job simplification tracks are rolled out in late 2014/early 2015.

                    <dt>What is the difference between iterative and agile?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            We transitioned from a sequencial waterfall approach to software development to a "chunked" iterative approach in 2011 which was a stepping stone to agile. The key hurdle we have really made great progress on with iterative is breaking the work down into smaller, more manageable chunks and getting feedback from the our business partners along the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A key focus is to continue to mature in breaking work down and demonstarting pieces of the solution through the life of initiative. In addition, what will we be instituionalizing with agile is some new lightweight practices, like scrum and kanban, new roles, an engagment model for the "horizontal" role such as data and Shared Services partners, BUT MOST IMPORTANT you will find a new mindset in the air. A mindset of flexibility in tools and techniques used; a mindset in autonomy of teams (self-directed teams); and a mindset of business value first and foremost!

                    <dt>Is agile an IT process?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            No, the agile values are riddled with the terms collaboration and communication. That means collaboration between business and IT, or better stated between the agile team. The Product Owner role is a member of the business who can prioritize work for the team to ensure high business value is generated quickly and often. This is done through regular (daily) collaboration and feedback. The PO is a key member of the agile core team.

                    <dt>How do I get an agile coach?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            A coaching support model is currently being established. In the meantime, you can contact a member of the PMO with your request or question.

                    <dt>How do I know what tools are available to support agile?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            There are several ways to determine the best tools for your agile initiative. Check with a team that has used is or using agile. Check with your coach or a member of the PMO. Research on-line tools available.
